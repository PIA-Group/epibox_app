# EpiBOX app
## Sharing the burden of data collection

EpiBOX is a user-friendly solution for long-term monitorings, enabling researchers to delegate the task of data collection to less proficient individuals.

EpiBOX app is a user-friendly interface to configure, start, visualize, pause and stop acquisitions with wearable devices. Currently, EpiBOX supports BITalino-based equipments allowing for the recording, storage and visualization of up to 12 channels simmultaneously. 

This mobile app is complementary to the Python package epibox (available @ [epibox (GitHub)](https://github.com/anascacais/epibox) and [epibox (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/epibox/)), designed for use with a Raspberry Pi.

## Features

- Step-by-step interactions to start the acquisition
- History of acquisition devices
- Default configurations for optimized interaction
- Real-time visualization of up-to 12 channels
- In-acquisition annotations

## Additional Resources

Why BITalino: 
 - Versatility of sensors & flexibility of wearable form-factors
 - Rapid & cheap prototyping
 - Peer-validated against gold-standards

Why Raspberry Pi:
 - Discreteness
 - Affordability 
 - Ease of system replication - through shell script or Docker (soon!)
 - Computational and storage power
